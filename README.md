# Hands-on_Lecture_2

For this assignment I have made the source code for two leetcode assignments, The first Pascals Trianlge I made all the rows with 1's filling up each element of the lists based off numRows. Then you update each element given the previous row's values excluding the ends of that previous row. For the Spiral matrix problem you iterate through the rows got from the top row to the end of that row and then in the second row skipping all the way to the end then vice versa till you get all the way to the end then you deincrament and so on. Comments are on the source code explaining what the code segments do.
